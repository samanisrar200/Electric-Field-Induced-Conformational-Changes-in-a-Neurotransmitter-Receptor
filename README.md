# Electric-Field-Induced-Conformational-Changes-in-a-Neurotransmitter-Receptor

Goal: Simulate how an electric field affects the structure of the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor (a key neuropharmacology target) and automate the workflow.

This project is a Python-based simulation exploring how an external electric field might induce conformational changes in the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor. It uses basic physics-inspired modeling and 3D visualization to illustrate molecular displacement without requiring heavy molecular dynamics software.

## ðŸ§ª Project Highlights

- Simulates atomic displacement due to a defined electric field vector.
- 3D visualization of conformational changes using `matplotlib` and `py3Dmol`.
- Lightweight and educational â€” no need for GROMACS, Rosetta, or MD engines.
- Modular code structure for easy extension.
